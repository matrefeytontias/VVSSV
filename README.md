### Half-assed README

To build, you need Haxe version 3.3.0 or later, as well as HaxePunk 2.6.0 . Summary of commands to be ran if you start fresh :

```bash
$ haxelib install HaxePunk
$ haxelib run HaxePunk setup
$ lime setup windows
```

After this is done, you're ready to build VVSSV by running `lime build` followed by one of the different HaxePunk targets
(type `lime help` to find more about that).

Be a pal and don't distribute this code or the resulting builds as your own and such. You know the drill. You can distribute
them, but please at least mention me, as I wrote all of this with my fingers. Also, the game includes credits, please don't
touch them, thank you o/
